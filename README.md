Fun with Spring Session and Spring Security

## TODO

- [ ] Load users from a database
- [ ] Controller for current user
- [ ] Use a password encoder/decoder (e.g. BCrypt ?)
- [ ] How to log out and delete session ?
- [ ] Does this play well with having another DB (h2 or normal) in the same project ?
